# Mobee
## WIP
⚠️ This project is a work-in-progress ⚠️

Mobee is an Open-Source Synced-Video-Player for Desktop (Windows) and Web (React), based on Client-Server architecture which works by utilizing SignalR. This repository contains the source code for the Windows Client and ASP.net server, along with the Web Client. A free Web Server is deployed on [Mobees.ir](https://mobees.ir/) and Clients are configured to use that server by default.
